Description: Fits generalized processing tree (GPT) models for multivariate data (a single discrete variable and one or more
    continuous response variables per trial). Extends multinomial processing tree (MPT) models by assuming that distribution 
    of continuous variables is a (mutlivariate) mixture distribution with the MPT core structure defining the mixture
    probabilities.
