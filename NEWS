gpt 0.5.0 (November 2017)
===========

* Goodness-of-fit statistics
* Improved stability



gpt 0.3.0 (August 2016)
===========

* testthat routines for unit checks
* Pedict MPT probability/mean/quantiles/density: predict.gpt.fit (S4 method)
* Plot model fit: cdf, qplot
* Subsetting to plot model fit separately per group


gpt 0.2.0 (June 2016)
===========

* S4 classes for mpt, gpt, univariate distributions
* S4 methods for densities and data generation (mpt, gpt, univariate distributions)
* better starting values, separately for each continuous distribution
* lower and upper bounds stored internally and adjusted for each eta parameter



gpt 0.1.0 (June 2015)
===========

* first version of gpt
* data generation: gen.gpt, gen.gpt.sample (allowing for heterogeneity)
* model fitting: fit.gpt (single data sets + whole sample using parallel computing)
* plotting model fit: plot.gpt (histgrams separately for response categories); qplot.gpt (x-axis: response probabilities per tree, y-axis: continuous quantiles)
* model comparisons by AIC, BIC: gpt.select
* latent continuous distributions: normal, lognormal, wald, gamma, exGauss, weibull
